# Bike-Rides-Analysis

## Project Overview
In this project I programmatically gather the data, explore and manipulate it using Python pandas library and then I create impactful interactive visualizations in Tableau, including total bike rides, moving average, temperature vs windspeed heatmap, rides split by weather and hour.

## Part 1 – Programatically gather data
I’m using the Kaggle API to download the dataset directly from Kaggle.

## Part 2 – Explore and manipulate the data using Python
I read the CSV as a pandas dataframe and I explore the data to have an overview of it. I identified some problems and and took the following actions:
-	I modified the columns to make them more manageable;
-	I created dictionaries to map the numerical values to actual written values;
-	I wrote the final dataframe to an excel file that I used for the Tableau visualisations.
The notebook used for the first 2 parts can be found here: [london_bikes_m.ipynb](https://github.com/miubogdan/Bike-Rides-Analysis/blob/main/london_bikes_m.ipynb)

## Part 3 – Create impactful visualizations in Tableau
I created 5 visualizations: total bike rides, moving average, temperature vs windspeed heatmap, rides split by weather and hour (per moving and per heatmap)
Below is a preview. You can check the interactive dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bogdan.miu/viz/LondonBikeRides_17092169883090/Dashboard1).
